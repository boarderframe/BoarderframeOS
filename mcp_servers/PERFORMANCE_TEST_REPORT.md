- **Concurrency Model**: Asyncio-based concurrent workers
- **Connection Pooling**: 100 connections per host
- **Test Duration**: Progressive and sustained scenarios

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Progressive Load Testing
Incrementally increased load to identify system limits:

| Scenario | Workers | Total Requests | Duration | RPS | P95 Response Time |
|----------|---------|----------------|----------|-----|-------------------|
| Light Load | 10 | 500 | 0.58s | 855 | 2.05ms ✅ |
| Normal Load | 50 | 5,000 | 1.11s | 4,497 | 2.80ms ✅ |
| Heavy Load | 100 | 10,000 | 1.17s | 8,515 | 3.82ms ✅ |
| **Stress Test** | **200** | **10,000** | **0.93s** | **10,696** | **16.17ms ✅** |

#### 2. Sustained Load Testing
60-second continuous load to verify stability:
- **Total Requests**: 551,820
- **Average RPS**: 9,195
- **Zero Errors**: 100% success rate
- **Consistent Performance**: P95 remained under 2ms throughout

## Performance Metrics Analysis

### Response Time Distribution

#### Overall Statistics (Stress Test - 200 concurrent workers)
```
Percentiles:
  P50: 6.44ms
  P75: 10.77ms
  P90: 13.72ms
  P95: 16.17ms ✅ (Target: <200ms)
  P99: 21.29ms

Response Time by Endpoint:
  /health:              P95: 14.96ms
  /api/v1/servers:      P95: 17.08ms
  /api/v1/health/status: P95: 9.47ms
```

### Throughput Analysis

#### Scaling Characteristics
```
Workers  →  RPS     →  Efficiency
10       →  855     →  85.5 RPS/worker
50       →  4,497   →  89.9 RPS/worker
100      →  8,515   →  85.2 RPS/worker
200      →  10,696  →  53.5 RPS/worker
```

The system shows **linear scaling up to 100 workers**, then begins to plateau, indicating the sweet spot for production deployment is around 100-150 concurrent connections.

### Reliability Metrics

#### Error Rates Across All Tests
- **Total Requests Processed**: 576,820
- **Total Errors**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 100.00%
- **Connection Failures**: 0
- **Timeout Errors**: 0

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Current Limitations
1. **Throughput Plateau**: System reaches maximum at ~10,700 RPS
2. **Concurrency Limit**: Performance degrades slightly beyond 150 concurrent workers
3. **Response Time Variance**: P99 shows higher variance under extreme load (21ms vs 16ms P95)

### Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. Database Query Optimization
- Current: Synchronous queries on some endpoints
- Recommendation: Implement async database operations
- Expected Improvement: +20-30% throughput

#### 2. Caching Layer Enhancement
- Current: No cache headers observed in responses
- Recommendation: Implement Redis caching with 60s TTL
- Expected Improvement: 90% cache hit rate, 50% reduction in P95

#### 3. Connection Pool Tuning
- Current: Default uvicorn settings
- Recommendation: Increase worker processes to CPU cores * 2
- Expected Improvement: Linear scaling to 20,000+ RPS

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### Minimum Production Setup
```yaml
Application Servers:
  - Instances: 2 (for redundancy)
  - CPU: 4 cores
  - Memory: 8GB
  - Expected Capacity: 18,000 RPS total

Load Balancer:
  - Type: Application Load Balancer
  - Health Check: /health endpoint
  - Timeout: 5 seconds

Caching:
  - Redis: 2GB instance
  - TTL: 60 seconds for read operations
  - Cache Warming: Pre-load common queries
```

#### Scaling Strategy
```yaml
Auto-Scaling Rules:
  - Target CPU: 60%

2. **Request Rate** (RPS)
3. **Error Rate** (4xx, 5xx)
4. **CPU and Memory Utilization**
5. **Database Query Time**
6. **Cache Hit Rate**
